# Advanced search help

The results are sorted by how good the text entered matches the phrase in ICD. It is also grouped by using the ICD hierarchy so that if the search text matches a parent category and several children, they will appear in a fashion that is easy to identify this relation visually. The list shows only the titles or the best match among the matched terms if the title is not a match.

If you provide more than one keyword, the system will search for items that have all the keywords.
